# Share my code about basic deep learning model

1. Use CNN to solve:[digital-recognition](https://github.com/wangteng200000318/basic-deep-learning-model/tree/main/mnist_recognition)

2. Use CNN to solve:[classification between cat and dog](https://github.com/wangteng200000318/basic-deep-learning-model/tree/main/cat_dog_classification), the data about cat and dog is from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition)

3. Use RNN to predict:[people emotion about movie](https://github.com/wangteng200000318/basic-deep-learning-model/tree/main/sentimental%20alalysis), data is from IMDB

4. Build an [encoder and decoder](https://github.com/wangteng200000318/basic-deep-learning-model/tree/main/encoder%26decode), data is from fashion mnist.
